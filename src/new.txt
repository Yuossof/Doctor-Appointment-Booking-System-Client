  We work hard to stay up to date with the most advanced techniques and technologies to ensure that our patients receive the best care possible. Our office utilizes 3D CBCT radiographs to allow for guided surgical and endodontic protocols. This enables these procedures to performed digitally before they are performed surgically to ensure optimal results. 3D imaging also is utilized for the analysis of airway growth and development. We also use the best 3D optical scanner for all of our dental restoration and Invisalign impressions. Dr Williams is a strong advocate for using microsurgical techniques, this means less discomfort and faster healing times.

  Dentists today already utilize software to capture insights in clinical decision-making. These practices will continue to develop to integrate AI algorithms that enable clinicians to find the best modalities for their patients. In the 21st century, digital radiographs and 3D imaging have become the standard of dental care. Using an intraoral scanner with digitized data for 3D dental impressions (vs. polyvinyl siloxane and rubber base impressions) for a dental crown is now commonplace. Artificial intelligence is laying the groundwork for the future of the dental industry. Dental robots can now perform functions such as filling cavities and cleaning or extracting teeth
